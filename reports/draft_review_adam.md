## Question:  What is your understanding of the experiment the team is replicating?  What question does it answer?  How clear is the team's explanation?
"How do the patterns form on ocellated lizards?"
Or:
"Do the patterns on ocellated lizards form by a process which is something like a two-dimensional Turing model?"

It's a little difficult to find a question that perfectly phrases what the project tries to do, but the project's goals are still clear -- just not necessarily in the form of a question.

## Methodology: Do you understand the methodology?  Does it make sense for the question?  Are there limitations you see that the team did not address?
The methodology seems simple.  (If it's not, there's something missing from the explanation!)  It's enough to answer the question in the sense that, yes, ocellated lizards do look like this.  It's not enough to prove that this is *why* the lizards look like this, but that might be outside the paper's scope (in which case that should be made clear).

## Results: Do you understand what the results are (not yet considering their interpretation)?  If they are presented graphically, are the visualizations effective?  Do all figures have labels on the axes and captions?
Almost.  It would be nice to have some pictures of lizards (ideally not cherry-picked) next to the results of the CA model.

## Interpretation: Does the draft report interpret the results as an answer to the motivating question?  Does the argument hold water?
There's not much interpretation / analysis.  The model is shown, with its results; the reader is left to draw their own conclusions regarding e.g. whether lizards actually work like this.

## Replication: Are the results in the report consistent with the results from the original paper?  If so, how did the authors demonstrate that consistency.  Is it quantitative or qualitative?
The replication is admittedly not identical to the original.  Also, there are no figures from the original presented in the paper.  (Also, the link and title are wrong?  Or the authors are wrong?)  Qualitatively, the papers' results look similar.

## Extension: Does the report explain an extension to the original experiment clearly?  Is it a sensible extension in the sense that it has the potential to answer an interesting question that the original experiment did not answer?
Mostly, and mostly.  The first two extensions are all reasonable directions to go.  The first (Brown/white to green/black transition) isn't given a thorough description of the mathematical model (e.g. constants) or of results (e.g. how long the flip took).  The second is explained well.  The third is explained well, but it's not clear what its goal is.  Perhaps this should be in a different paper...?

(Also: "Adding brown white states" isn't grammatically correct; there should be a "/" or an "and" or something between "brown" and "white".)

## Progress: Is the team roughly where they should be at this point, with a replication that is substantially complete and an extension that is clearly defined and either complete or nearly so?
Yep!

## Presentation: Is the report written in clear, concise, correct language?  Is it consistent with the audience and goals of the report?  Does it violate any of the recommendations in my style guide?
It could be shorter, but what couldn't?

More figures would be nice, especially comparisons (model to real life, this model to that model).

It talks a bit about the development process ("The first experiment we implemented..."), which should probably be rephrased in a mode information- or reader-centric way.

The last experiment doesn't really belong.  Math is fun, but that's not what this is about.

The whole abstract probably shouldn't be bold =P

## Mechanics: Is the report in the right directory with the right file name?  Is it formatted professionally in Markdown?  Does it include a meaningful title and the full names of the authors?  Is the bibliography in an acceptable style? 

Yes, except that the last bibliography entry is broken (I think two entries got mashed together here).
