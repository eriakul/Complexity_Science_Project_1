# Question:  What is your understanding of the experiment the team is replicating?  What question does it answer?  How clear is the team's explanation?

So my understanding is the model simulates the progress of entropy and demonstrates how the reversal of entropy is time symmetric. The model you're replicating is the Q2R Ising Model automaton which increases in entropy as time moves forward, but reversing the time steps allow you to retrieve previous states. The explanation of the model was very clear, but I'm not sure what the question you're trying to answer is: "Is entropy is time symmetric?" or "How is the development of entropy determined by the initial state of the system?"


# Methodology: Do you understand the methodology?  Does it make sense for the question?  Are there limitations you see that the team did not address?

The methodology makes sense for the "How is the development of entropy determined by the initial state of the system?" question.

# Results: Do you understand what the results are (not yet considering their interpretation)?  If they are presented graphically, are the visualizations effective?  Do all figures have labels on the axes and captions?

Good graphical representations. Also the first figure of the Q2R Ising Model automaton was really helpful in explaining what it was. 

# Interpretation: Does the draft report interpret the results as an answer to the motivating question?  Does the argument hold water?

Again, I was unclear on what the motivating question was. 

# Replication: Are the results in the report consistent with the results from the original paper?  If so, how did the authors demonstrate that consistency.  Is it quantitative or qualitative?

Yes. Good job recreating and then invalidating their model. 


# Extension: Does the report explain an extension to the original experiment clearly?  Is it a sensible extension in the sense that it has the potential to answer an interesting question that the original experiment did not answer?

I assume that your analysis on the variance of entropy based on initial conditions was your extension.

This last part was great. 

# Progress: Is the team roughly where they should be at this point, with a replication that is substantially complete and an extension that is clearly defined and either complete or nearly so?

Yes, you're in a good place.

# Presentation: Is the report written in clear, concise, correct language?  Is it consistent with the audience and goals of the report?  Does it violate any of the recommendations in my style guide?

Violates his "don't use 'very'" rule 3 times but I think your use of it is ok. 

# Mechanics: Is the report in the right directory with the right file name?  Is it formatted professionally in Markdown?  Does it include a meaningful title and the full names of the authors?  Is the bibliography in an acceptable style? 

Yep, looks good.
